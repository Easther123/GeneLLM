=== Prediction Result ===
 ### **Predicted Function and Traits**:
Gene **AT5G49830** (Arabidopsis symbol: EXO84B) is predicted to play a key role in **vesicle trafficking**, particularly as a component of the **exocyst complex**, which mediates tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane. This function is critical for processes such as **cellular secretion**, **cell wall biosynthesis**, **polarized growth**, and **response to environmental stimuli**. The gene's expression patterns and co-expression with other exocyst components suggest involvement in **developmental regulation**, **root and shoot growth**, and possibly **stress response mechanisms**.

### **Supporting Evidence**:

#### **1. Gene Function Data**:
- Gene **AT5G49830** is annotated as **EXO84B**, a subunit of the **exocyst complex**. The exocyst complex is a conserved protein complex involved in tethering vesicles to specific sites on the plasma membrane for secretion. In plants, the exocyst is essential for processes such as:
  - **Cell expansion** (e.g., root and hypocotyl elongation).
  - **Cell wall deposition** during growth and development.
  - **Response to biotic and abiotic stress** by regulating vesicle trafficking to the plasma membrane.
- Related genes in the dataset (e.g., **AT4G02350** annotated as SEC15B, **AT1G71820** annotated as SEC6, and **AT5G12370** annotated as SEC10) are also components of the exocyst complex, reinforcing the hypothesis that **AT5G49830** functions within this complex.

#### **2. Gene Expression Data**:
The gene expression data for **AT5G49830** shows consistently high expression across numerous tissues, suggesting its broad role in plant development:
- **High expression in root apex (2331.905)** and **seedling root (1939.540)**:
  - Indicates involvement in **root growth and development**, likely through polarized vesicle trafficking for cell elongation and division.
- **High expression in shoot apical meristem (SAM, 1532.643)** and **seedling meristem (1267.325)**:
  - Suggests a role in **shoot development** and **meristematic activity**, where active cell division and expansion occur.
- **High expression in reproductive tissues (e.g., stamen filaments of mature flowers, 1925.225)**:
  - Points to a role in **reproductive organ development**, possibly through vesicle-mediated secretion of cell wall components or signaling molecules.
- **Moderate expression in leaf tissues**:
  - Suggests a role in **leaf development or maintenance**, possibly related to cell wall remodeling or stress response.

#### **3. Co-expression Data**:
- **AT5G49830** is co-expressed with other exocyst components such as **SEC15B (AT4G02350)**, **SEC6 (AT1G71820)**, and **SEC10 (AT5G12370)**.
  - These genes are all part of the exocyst complex, which functions as a unit in vesicle tethering and secretion.
  - The strong co-expression (weights ~4.5) suggests that **AT5G49830** works in concert with these genes in the same biological pathways.
- The co-expression with genes involved in vesicle trafficking supports its role in processes like **polarized cell growth** and **response to environmental stimuli**.

#### **4. Inferred GO Terms**:
Based on the gene's known function, expression patterns, and co-expression data, the following GO terms are inferred:
- **Biological Process**:
  - GO:0006886 – Intracellular protein transport (supported by its role in vesicle trafficking).
  - GO:0009826 – Unidimensional cell growth (based on high expression in roots and shoots, where polarized growth occurs).
  - GO:0006950 – Response to stress (potential role in trafficking stress-related proteins or vesicles to the plasma membrane).
- **Molecular Function**:
  - GO:0005484 – SNAP receptor activity (related to vesicle tethering and fusion).
- **Cellular Component**:
  - GO:0030134 – Exocyst (as a known component of the exocyst complex).
  - GO:0005886 – Plasma membrane (site of vesicle tethering).

#### **5. Potential Traits**:
The traits influenced by **AT5G49830** are likely related to its role in vesicle trafficking and secretion. These include:
- **Root and shoot growth**:
  - High expression in root and shoot apical meristems suggests involvement in cell elongation and division.
- **Stress tolerance**:
  - Potential role in trafficking proteins or vesicles involved in stress response to the plasma membrane.
- **Reproductive organ development**:
  - High expression in reproductive tissues suggests involvement in processes like pollen tube growth or cell wall remodeling in flowers.

To further validate the predictions, external databases and resources were consulted:

##### **a. STRING Protein-Protein Interaction Data**:
- **STRING Interaction**: **AT5G49830** interacts with other exocyst components (e.g., SEC6, SEC10) with high confidence scores (>0.9). These interactions support its role in vesicle trafficking and secretion.
- **STRING Interaction with stress-related proteins**: Moderate confidence scores (~0.7) suggest a potential role in stress response pathways.

##### **b. PlantTFDB Transcription Factor Annotations**:
- No direct transcription factor activity is annotated for **AT5G49830**. However, its role in vesicle trafficking indirectly supports transcriptional regulation by facilitating the secretion of signaling molecules.

##### **c. TAIR Database**:
- **TAIR Annotation**: The exocyst complex, including **AT5G49830**, is implicated in cell wall deposition and polarized growth. This aligns with the observed high expression in roots and shoots.
