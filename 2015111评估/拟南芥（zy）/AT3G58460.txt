AT3G58460 is co-expressed with genes involved in similar pathways, suggesting functional associations:
- **Co-expressed Genes**:
  - **AT5G07250 (RBL3)**, **AT3G59520 (RBL13)**, and **AT3G17611 (RBL14)**: All are RHOMBOID-like proteins, indicating a shared role in **membrane-associated proteolysis** or **signaling pathways**.
  - **AT3G05790 (LON4)**: A mitochondrial protease involved in **protein homeostasis** and **stress responses**, suggesting AT3G58460 might also function in mitochondrial processes.
  - **AT1G77860**: While no functional data is available, its co-expression with other RHOMBOID-like genes supports its involvement in similar pathways.

#### **4. BLAST Similarity Data**:
- No BLAST similarity data is available for AT3G58460. However, its classification as a RHOMBOID-like protein and co-expression with other RHOMBOID-like genes strongly suggests conserved functions within this family, such as **protein cleavage in membranes** or **stress signaling**.

#### **5. Upregulation/Downregulation Analysis**:
- **Upregulation**:
  - In **senescent tissues** (e.g., senescent leaf petiole, dry seeds): Indicates a role in **senescence-associated processes** like nutrient remobilization or programmed cell death.
  - In **root apex and seedling root**: Suggests involvement in **root development** and **nutrient uptake**.
  - In **reproductive tissues** (e.g., stigmatic tissue, mature flowers): Indicates a role in **reproductive development** and **seed maturation**.
- **Downregulation**:
  - Lower expression in **opened anthers** and **inflorescence axis** suggests reduced activity in these tissues, possibly reflecting tissue-specific regulatory roles.
