### **2. Supporting Evidence**:

#### **A. Gene Expression Data**:
The expression levels of AT5G58100 across various tissues indicate its potential biological roles:
- **High expression in vascular tissues** (e.g., leaf veins, root apex, and internodes):
  - Suggests involvement in **vascular development**, including the regulation of nutrient and water transport.
- **High expression in reproductive tissues** (e.g., stamen filaments, stigmatic tissue, carpels):
  - Indicates a role in **reproductive development**, such as pollen tube guidance or ovule fertilization.
- **Significant expression in senescent internodes**:
  - Points to a role in **nutrient remobilization** during late developmental stages.
- **Expression in germinating seeds**:
  - Suggests a role in **seedling establishment and early growth**.

#### **B. Co-expression Data**:
AT5G58100 is co-expressed with 'AT2G35230' (IKU1), a VQ motif-containing protein linked to **seed development**. This relationship supports the hypothesis that AT5G58100 may also function in seed-related processes, such as embryogenesis or nutrient allocation.

Additionally, 'AT2G35230' is co-expressed with other genes involved in transcriptional regulation and stress responses, reinforcing the hypothesis that AT5G58100 may participate in **developmental regulation** and **stress signaling pathways**.

#### **C. Absence of BLAST Data**:
The lack of BLAST similarity data for AT5G58100 limits direct functional inference from homologous genes. However, the co-expression and expression datasets compensate for this limitation by providing indirect evidence for its role in specific biological processes.

#### **D. Gene Function Data**:
No direct functional annotations are available for AT5G58100. However, its co-expression with IKU1, a protein involved in seed development, and its high expression in vascular and reproductive tissues suggest that it may act as a regulatory gene in **developmental pathways**.

#### **E. Comparative Analysis**:
AT5G58100's expression profile aligns with genes involved in **vascular development**, **stress adaptation**, and **reproductive regulation**, as seen in other Arabidopsis genes with similar expression patterns.
