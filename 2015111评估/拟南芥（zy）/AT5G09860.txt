### **Supporting Evidence**:

#### **1. Gene Function Data**:
- Gene **AT5G09860** is annotated as a "nuclear matrix protein-related" and is homologous to **THO1**, a subunit of the **THO/TREX complex** in Arabidopsis. The THO/TREX complex is known to:
  - Facilitate **mRNA synthesis and export** from the nucleus.
  - Maintain **genome stability** by preventing R-loop formation during transcription.
  - Play a role in **transcription elongation** and **stress responses**.
- Related genes co-expressed with **AT5G09860** include **AT1G24706 (THO2)**, **AT5G42920 (THO5)**, and **AT5G16790 (THO7)**, all of which are subunits of the THO complex, further supporting its role in RNA processing.

#### **2. Gene Expression Data**:
The expression data for **AT5G09860** shows high levels in tissues with **active cell division and transcription**, such as:
- **Seedling Meristem (870.68)** and **SAM (946.28)**: Indicates involvement in transcriptional regulation during early plant development.
- **Inflorescence Meristem (899.98)** and **Anthers of the mature flower (1057.5)**: Suggests a role in reproductive development.
- **Young Leaf Lamina (876.02)** and **Leaf Petiole (760.48)**: Suggests involvement in leaf development and transcriptional activity.
- **Axis of the Inflorescence (905.98)**: Indicates a role in the elongation and development of the inflorescence axis.

**Upregulation**:
- The gene is highly expressed in **meristematic tissues**, **young leaves**, and **anther tissues**, where active transcription and cell division occur.
- Its expression in reproductive tissues highlights its potential role in **pollen development** or **gametophyte viability**.

**Downregulation**:
- Lower expression levels in **root tissues** (e.g., Root: 567.98, Root Apex: 721.71) suggest a reduced role in transcriptional regulation in these tissues.

#### **3. Co-expression Data**:
- **AT5G09860** is co-expressed with other THO/TREX complex subunits:
  - **AT1G24706 (THO2)**, **AT5G42920 (THO5)**, and **AT5G16790 (THO7)**. These genes are known components of the THO complex, which supports mRNA processing and export.
  - **AT2G19430 (DWA1)**: A DWD (DDB1-binding WD40 protein) involved in **ABA signaling** and stress responses, suggesting a potential link between the THO complex and abiotic stress pathways.
  - **AT5G56130 (TEX1)**: Another THO complex subunit, further reinforcing the involvement of **AT5G09860** in RNA processing and transcription regulation.

The strong co-expression with other THO complex subunits supports the hypothesis that **AT5G09860** functions as part of the THO/TREX complex in Arabidopsis.

#### **4. BLAST Similarity Data**:
- No BLAST data is available for **AT5G09860**, which limits direct evolutionary comparisons. However, the gene’s functional annotation as **THO1** and its co-expression with other THO complex subunits strongly suggest conserved roles in RNA processing and transcription regulation.

### **Upregulation/Downregulation Analysis**:
- **Upregulated Tissues**:
  - **Meristematic Tissues**: High expression in the **SAM**, **seedling meristem**, and **inflorescence meristem** suggests active involvement in transcriptional regulation during early development.
  - **Reproductive Tissues**: High expression in **anthers of mature flowers** and **inflorescence axis** indicates a role in reproductive development and pollen viability.
  - **Young Leaves**: Suggests a role in transcriptional regulation during leaf development.

- **Downregulated Tissues**:
  - **Roots**: Lower expression in root tissues suggests reduced involvement in transcriptional regulation in these tissues.

These trends align with the gene's predicted role in **transcriptional regulation** and **mRNA processing** in tissues with high transcriptional activity.
